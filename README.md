# ME-Commerce-Site
#E-Commerce App
I was asked to use preexisting code to set up CRUD Routes and sequelize models for an E-Commerce Site. However this applicating is a server side app and therefore was not deployed with a UI..

## Installation
I employed Multiple Node Packages in addition to the node.js environment itself:
1. dotenv for projection of system variables.
2. express.js for the creating of APIs to interact with a database.
3. pg to interact with postgres.
4. sequelize for creation of database models.
5. nodemon for quick restart and update of server.

1.In addition I used JavaScript for functionality.

## Usage
This ecommerce application will be used to access stored seed data in a ecommerce inventory. The user can browse items by category, product, tag and tag-name. It will allow for the GET of data, the POST of new categories and products and DELETE of existing products.
